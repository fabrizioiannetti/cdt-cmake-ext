= CMake extensions for CDT =

CDT supports CMake project by providing a specific C/C++ project type.
Unfortunately the UI to 

== The cmakeopts.json file format ==

This is a configuration file used to describe how to call cmake:

* define the top-level `CMakeLists.txt`
* define the build directory
* list build types (`Debug`, `Release`, ...) and for each one the parameters list

Example:

----
{
  rootCMakeLists : "path/to/CMakeLists.txt",
  buildDirectory : "path/to/build"
  generator: "Ninja",
  buildTypes: [
    {
      type : "Debug",
      cmakeArgs : ""
    },
    {
      type : "Release",
      cmakeArgs : ""
    },
    ...
  ]
}
----

The plugin offers an editor for this file (it is registered to open files named `cmakeopts.json`)
and a UI to invoke `cmake` as defined by the configuration file.
